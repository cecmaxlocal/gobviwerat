Safe deposit box licenses typically refer to the regulatory permissions and operational requirements that businesses must comply with to offer safe custody services for valuables such as jewelry, documents, and other high-value items.

Key points:

- Businesses offering safe custody services (including rental of safe deposit boxes) usually must register with a relevant regulatory authority such as financial services regulators (e.g., FCA in the UK).
- They are required to implement anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures, including customer due diligence and record-keeping.
- The license defines rights and responsibilities of both the custodian and the licensee (customer), including access control, identity verification, and security protocols.
- Safe deposit box agreements clarify the relationship is usually licensor-licensee, not landlord-tenant, and custodians do not hold or supervise the contents beyond physical storage.
- Legal policies govern how contents are handled, documented, and released, including special handling for wills or trust documents.
- Administrative controls such as managing authorized users (licensees, mandatees), changes to box size, and record updates are part of licensing compliance.
- Fees and contractual terms often accompany the license, as regulated by the institution or jurisdiction.

In general, offering safe deposit box services requires formal regulatory approvals to ensure security, legal compliance, and protection against financial crimes. Customers receive a license to access a secure box but the institution retains control over the physical security and legal obligations.

For detailed requirements, consult the specific jurisdiction’s financial or banking regulatory body, such as the FCA, FDIC, or local central bank.[1][2][3][4][5]
