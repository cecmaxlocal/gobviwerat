Here is a summary of Gobby, the collaborative text editor, to help guide the creation or understanding of an HTTP-based editor like "gobby" you mentioned:

- Gobby is a multi-platform collaborative text editor supporting simultaneous editing by multiple users over the internet in real time.
- It includes features such as syntax highlighting (using GtkSourceView), multi-document support in sessions, lock-free real-time collaboration, local group undo, cursor and selection display for remote users, and user-color highlighting.
- It integrates an IRC-like chat for communication during editing sessions.
- Gobby supports encrypted connections including perfect forward secrecy (PFS), optional password protection for sessions, and advanced access control lists (ACLs).
- It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (through X11), and features a dedicated server (infinoted) for managing collaborative sessions.
- The editor is designed for plaintext editing but supports multiple programming and markup languages with syntax highlighting.
- Gobby uses a client-server architecture, synchronizes documents on demand, and supports Zeroconf on Linux to automatically discover peers in the same network.

If you want to create a Dart or web-based editor inspired by Gobby, you'd focus on:

- WebSocket or HTTP for real-time collaborative editing communication.
- Text editing components with syntax highlighting support.
- User session and access control management.
- Encrypted data transfer for security.
- Integrated chat functionality alongside the editor.

Would you like a specific Dart/Flutter example to start an HTTP-based collaborative editor inspired by Gobby? Or details on server/client implementation? This guidance can be tailored to your needs.
